      "plumbing_hvac": "LLFA is tough enough to repair damaged and leaking pipes subject to pressure and temperature variants, without having to turn off the water source. It will seal leaks up to 150 PSI (water, air and steam). A punctured hose or pipe tightly wrapped with LLFA will immediately withstand internal pressure because the fusing action takes place so quickly.\n\nLLFA’s specified water absorption is <0.5% (the mil spec requirement for silicone based products is <3.0%). Based on the extremely low water absorption characteristic and its high tensile strength, water or moisture will not absorb through the tape.\n\nUnlike LLFA, other products are less effective in extreme cold or humid conditions. LLFA Tape maintains temperature stability and can be stored on the dashboard of your truck on the hottest day, or in your toolbox on the coldest day.\n\nLLFA’s most common color is red, but that does not stop it from being green, environmentally safe and non-toxic safe for drinking water (WRAS approved). (Add later when we have official approval)\n\nLLFA Tape works great on galvanized, copper, PVC, cast iron and various forms of plastic pipes. It also stops and prevents corrosion while being suitable for burial.",
      "natural_gas": "LLFA Tape was designed to seal leaks in harsh weather conditions and is currently used as a permanent repair for natural gas leaks by leading natural gas companies, both locally and internationally. LLFA can also be used as an emergency temporary repair by first responders.\n\nLLFA Features include:\n• Straight-forward application and minimal prep time\n• Proven stable from -90°C to 260°C / -130°F to 500°F\n• Maintains properties if exposed to CH4, H2S & O2\n• Tensile strength: >1,200 PSI\n• Leak sealing up to 150 PSI or 1 MPa\n• Highly UV and Ozone resistant\n• Simple removal; no sticky residue\n• Environmentally safe solution that will not contribute to exterior pipe corrosion.\n\nThe strength of LLFA makes it both a competent insulation solution and an invaluable puncture repair product. A punctured hose or pipe tightly wrapped with LLFA will immediately withstand internal pressure because the fusing action takes place so quickly.\n\nUnlike LLFA, other products are less effective in extreme cold or humid conditions. LLFA Tape maintains temperature stability and can be stored on the dashboard of your truck on the hottest day, or in your toolbox on the coldest night.",
      "electrical": "LLFA forms an enduring seal that is suitable for low, medium and high voltage applications, for up to 69,000 volts and has been used to insulate jumpers on high voltage transmission lines. Just two layers of LLFA Tape has a dielectric value of up to 32 KV, and is suitable for many electrical applications including: insulating motor leads, joints, terminations and cable jacket repairs.\n\nLLFA can be utilized to insulate and seal electrical cable splices where high and low temperature stability is needed, and where moisture, weather resistance is required. LLFA is specifically proven through independent lab testing to be reliable within the -90°C to 260°C or -130°F to 500°F temperature range.\n\nUnlike LLFA, other products are less effective in extreme cold or humid conditions. LLFA maintains temperature stability and can be stored on the dashboard of your truck on the hottest day, or in your toolbox on the coldest day.\n\nLLFA can also be used for jointing, harnessing, waterproofing and UV shielding. It is also suitable for burial, and is environmentally safe and non-toxic.",
      "telecom": "LLFA tape is an ideal product for Telecom industry technicians. As it is comprised of self-fusing layers that form a long-term compression seal, it is able to maintain its properties, even under extreme environmental conditions.\n\nLLFA is waterproof. LLFA’s specified water absorption is less than 0.5% (the requirement for most silicone based products is <3.0%). Based on the extremely low water absorption characteristic and its high tensile strength, water or moisture will not absorb through the tape or migrate along the cable jacket.\n\nThe strength of LLFA tape makes it both a competent insulation solution and an invaluable puncture repair product. A punctured hose or pipe tightly wrapped with LLFA tape will immediately withstand internal pressure because the fusing action takes place so quickly. It can seal leaks up to 150 PSI air and steam.\n\nUnlike LLFA, other products are less effective in extreme cold or humid conditions. LLFA Tape maintains temperature stability and can be stored on the dashboard of your truck on the hottest day, or in your toolbox on the coldest night.\n\nLLFA Tape is easily applied, durable and resilient. It is also suitable for burial, and is environmentally safe and non-toxic."
