It is an ideal product for electricians, plumbers, and natural gas technicians.\n\nHow it Works: LLFA® Tape can be applied on almost any surface material, from galvanized and cast iron to copper and all types of plastics or rubber. It contains no adhesive, so pulling the tape as tight as possible on all layers allows it to seal by compression. Once applied, LLFA® fuses with itself, thus forming a heavy duty bond or “rubber sheath” on the leak or connection. As its primary function is sealing through compression, there is no issue with adhesion and compatibility. It doesn’t lose its tension over time, even in harsh environments."

So far this is looking good and we will continue to monitor it for the next several days.\n\nI have attached some before and after pics for you.\n\nThanks for spending the time with me a few months ago and for your time with our Engineer.”",
        "description2": "During an LLFA® Tape demonstration, performed by GTG® Engineering, Inc. at JEA, Northside Station, a request was made to repair a turbine oil leak. The leak was at the interface of a smaller diameter externally threaded pipe into a larger diameter internally (female) threaded pipe that was associated with a Primary Air Fan for a 310 Megawatt, circulating Fluidized Bed boiler. The bearing is a Sleevoil Pillow Block Bearing. The leak was sealed using LLFA® Smooth around the dimensional change and 2″ wide LLFA® Tape over the entire connection. The JEA Manager Electric Production Maintenance stated that the repair would have cost $17,000.00 due to the fact that in order to make a full repair, the unit would have to be derated since they would have lost half the generating capacity of the unit for the length of the repair.\n\nOn JEA performed a repair, themselves, using LLFA® Tape and LLFA® Smooth in which the leak was coming from a flat plate where the pipe fitting entered the plate. . There was oil leaking from the flat plate at the fitting. GTG® normally recommends that LLFA® Tape must extend a minimum of 1 to 1.5″ beyond the leak in order to make an effective seal; however, JEA used a combination of LLFA® Tape and LLFA® Smooth to create a “tadpole gasket” which was able to seal against a flat plate. I think we can safely say 1.25 to 1.5 gallons of oil in a 24 hour period. Below is an excerpt of the e-mail from JEA.\n\n“. I came up with a solution for that (sealing a leak against a flat plate) using your product (LLFA®). I cut a thin piece of smooth, rolled it into a thin cylinder shape and then wrapped it around one side of tape. Similar to a tadpole gasket. I applied it pressing the smooth to the flat plate. The theory being that the compression of the tape would press the encapsulated smooth against the plate, creating a seal. Looks like it worked. Impressed so far.”\n\nOn JEA Northside performed another “tadpole gasket” style repair, using LLFA® Tape and LLFA® Smooth. Below is an excerpt of the e-mail from JEA.\n\n“Hope all is well with you. These pictures show another oil leak that we wrapped. It is on a bearing similar to the one you guys (GTG®) did for me. The difference being that this bearing is larger and was actually leaking about twice as bad, 2.5 + gallons every 24 hours. This is taken 48 hours after wrapping and shows no sign of any leakage. This stuff is good. Thanks “",
        "description3": "As we all know, access to clean water as well as properly maintained gas are basic necessities, but it is a huge task to keep all of the systems and infrastructure working. Without these, there are obvious implications, such as low access to potable water and higher incidences of water-related diseases.  Access to a suitable water source does not necessarily mean access to clean water. Pipes can be rusted, corroded and contaminated, which can also create dangerous leaks in gas lines.  So in a country as heavily populated as China, maintaining proper city infrastructure can present a huge challenge.\n\nOn April 2nd 2018, a port in southwest China’s gas company used our products, LLFA® Smooth, LLFA® Tape and LLFA® Garde, to seal the city’s main gas line.  It had been corroded and had an operating pressure of 7 kg.\n\nFor this task, the construction crew used LLFA® Smooth to fill in the corroded areas for extra leak blockage, followed by the 2 inch-wide LLFA® compression tape.  They also used our LLFA® tensor tool in order to pull the tape to it’s maximum tension for the most effective results. The finished repair was further protected by our LLFA® Garde.\n\nIn total, sealing this major leak on a main city gas line took 40 minutes to complete with effective results. Thanks to all the diligent city workers who help keep our water and gas lines free of leaks and corrosion!",
        "description4": "In March of 2015, we had a serious flooding in the walls in our heritage home. During the winter, snow and ice had built up in the valleys of the roof, causing water and condensation to gather in the walls until our living room ceiling came crashing down. This process is known as “ice damming”.\n\nIt required a major renovation from our insurance company contractors, who had to tear down the rotted drywall. When the walls were down and the pipes were exposed, we found this vertical sewer pipe approximately 60-years old. This cast pipe had developed pin hole leaks which had been sealed by an ineffective material that had leaked out of the holes it was intended to plug (*pic A).  If they had gotten worse, it would’ve required us to open the wall again. So the prevent future issues, we wrapped the pipe with LLFA® Tape (*Pic B).\n\nThe benefit to using LLFA® Tape is, once its applied, it fuses with itself, thus forming a bond or “rubber sheath” on the leak or connection. As its primary function is sealing through compression, there is no issue with adhesion and compatibility. It doesn’t lose its tension over time, even in harsh environments.!",

I was able to get under my deck to apply the tape - it worked perfectly!  I was really impressed by how well it works - easy to apply and no water seepage.\" - From Andrew Stewart \n\nCustomer Review #2 - Electrical repair by Algonquin college construction student, Tim Hawkins\n\n\"We were changing the pump in the fountain in the parking lot. We couldn't take the wires out of the base of the fountain. so we had to take the base off. But the screws were stripped from the base of the rock fountain. So we either had to drill out the screws and put new screws into the concrete or cut the wire. We were thinking of trying to take the base of the fountain off even though it would be lots of work as we hadn't considered another solution.  When we bought the pump, it came with a plug that wouldn't fit through the hole in the top of the base of the fountain. So the only way we could install it was to cut the wire. So we decided to use the tape to repair the wire. Worked perfectly.\n\nWe used it in the kitchen there was a drain pipe that had a seal broken. They didn't have one that would fix it. So I wrapped it with the tape and it's all good and hasn't leaked since.\" \n\nGTG® Engineering Canada would love to hear from you!

The freezer was down because the heating cable had overheated and melted through the compressor drain pipe. It was wrapped around the drain line to stop it from freezing.\n\nReplacement parts could not be acquired until later in the journey so a quick and effective solution was needed in order for the food service to continue. LLFA® Tape was applied to the pipe to insulate from any electrical short and melting down the pipe. The heating cable was then reapplied around the pipe and put into service.\n\nfor example, the ship currently known as the MV Doulos Phos held the record of being the world's oldest active ocean-faring passenger ship until December 2009, having traveled the world's oceans from the time of her building in 1914.  When members of GTG® were able to visit to Doulos, there were 200+ persons on board the ship.\n\nWe were able to tour the Engine room, see the large engines.\n\nDuring the trip, there was a sea water leak located in the engine room.  Under normal circumstances, the crew would have had to shut down the engines and drain the system in the middle of the voyage far out at sea.  However, the chief engineer knew about our LLFA® products, had a roll in his desk, and decided to try it. LLFA® Tape sealed the leak until they could get to a dry dock port where many other repairs were being done. The pipe was eventually re-welded.\n\nIn both cases, LLFA® Tape came to the rescue and saved both time and money by offering a quick and economical solution in emergency situations.",

        "description9": "LLFA® IN-BOX:\nWe recently received an interesting e-mail from a customer of ours named Constance from Cardinal, Ontario.  She shared with us that while she was in Florida this past January, the water line that had been installed to their house fifty years ago had sprung a leak at the street.   She contacted the city to shut the water off and planned to look after repairing the line when they returned from their holidays at the end of March.\n\nplumberShe had been advised that twenty years ago, a repair near the city’s main line had been done by a local plumber, but to her amazement, the local plumbers did not want the job of repairing just the leak. They wanted to bring in a back hoe, dig up her front yard, remove the maple tree as well as remove parts of her deck to install a brand new copper line from the city’s main line to their house, all for a minimum cost of $3500!!\n\nshovelIn addition to the sizable cost, Constance did not want to lose her maple tree and part of her deck, so she dug up the area with a round-nosed shovel.  She was able to locate two small hair-linecracks caused from frost damage at the copper joints located between the mainline and the galvanized line to her home.\n\nIn an effort to learn how to fix this problem herself, she went online and the local public works superintendent brought her a roll of LLFA® Compression Tape.  She used the tape and, in her words, “WOW …we actually stopped those leaks!” \n\nThis is a good example of how costly the removal and replacement of leaky pipes can be.  Although there are times when you may need to contact a professional, learning how to spot and repair leaks on your own can greatly minimize your cost and frustration and over-priced contractors.\n\n\nHOW TO REPAIR A LEAK:\n\nAs soon as you spot a leak, deal with it immediately.  This can be tricky, and may take up a good part of your day, but will prevent further costly damage being done to your home.\n\nbucketFirst, find a bucket or a bowl and put it underneath the leak to catch the dripping water.  Then, turn off the water supply to that area.  This is done by finding the valve on the supply pipe and turning it clockwise.  If you can’t find this, turn off the water for the entire house at the main, which is located where the cold water pipe enters the building.\n\nTIP:  If the leak is in the ceiling and water is dripping through from a specific spot, make a small hole in the ceiling with a screwdriver and place a bucket underneath to catch the drips.  This may prevent the water from building up and bringing the whole ceiling down.\n\nOption 1:  For a quick fix, you’ll need a pipe clamp, or a length of hose and a C-Clamp, which you can get at your local Home Depot or hardware store.   Stick the pipe clamp over the leaky pipe, or if you don’t have one of these on hand, improvise with a piece of rubber clipped from a hose.    Make sure it is longer than the damage in the pipe, then slice it lengthwise and wrap it against the pipe.  Hold it in place with a C-clamp and two blocks of wood; this should secure the leak as a temporary measure.\n\nOption 2:  Epoxy Putty.  This easily molded stuff is good for joints and fittings.  Clean the pipes with a cloth first to get rid of any dirt and dust. To ensure your hands are protected, you can use rubber gloves before applying.   Mix the putty as per the manufacturer’s instructions and then once it’s soft and pliable, press it around the leak, making sure there is good coverage.  It will take anywhere from a couple of hours to a day to dry, depending on the product.\n\nOption 3:  Use a sealant tape, such as LLFA® Compression Tape, which you can now purchase in strip packs at all Home llfa® tape 2 Depot Stores across Canada, or at most plumbing supply stores throughout Ontario.    This is a strong, water-tight self-fusing tape that can easily be wrapped around pipes.  This will not only stop the leak, but will help you avoid the costly expense of replacing the pipes.\n\nTIP 2:  If the leak has been an on-going one and there is noticeable damage to the surrounding wood and areas near the leak, be sure to call a licensed professional.  Excessive water damage can cause mould and rot, which, if left untreated, can affect the structural stability of your home.",
        "description10": "In an industrial oil pipeline, a high temperature leak occurred. Pressure and temperature of saturated steam is directly proportional to each other; the higher the temperature, the greater the pressure. [163 ° C saturated steam pressure is 0.6MPa; 260 ° C, saturated steam pressure is 4.7MPa].\n\nThe LLFA® Tape has a stable operating temperature that ranges between -90 ° C to +260 ° C.  In order to effectively use LLFA® Tape for high temperature sealing leaks, it is necessary to be able to block the leakage, while also withstanding high temperatures.  LLFA®, when applied properly, can seal steam as well as water and air.",
        "description11": "Older homes are often known for their charms and quirks, and when well maintained they can command a premium for buyers seeking history or craftsmanship. But ask anyone who owns a house built prior to 1950, and they can tell you just how hard it can be to keep it properly maintained and updated.\n\nOne common problem in older homes is old pipes. Years ago, state of the art in plumbing was cast-iron drains and brass supply pipes. Now, those materials have been supplanted (for the most part) by PVC plastic, copper, and flexible cross-linked polyethylene, known as PEX. But whether the pipes are plastic, metal, or a combination of the two, a lot is at stake: One leaky joint can cause thousands of dollars worth of damage and, if you’re like most home owners living on a budget, that’s an expense that would cause a serious dent in your finances.\n\nMark, the owner of a turn of the century residential home in Niagara Falls, ON. had recently encountered this problem when he noticed water damage in the ceiling around a leaking pipe in his basement. Due to the age of the thread, the joint in the old pipe was not sealing and connecting to the new PEX pipe. Rather than having to resort to a costly plumbing bill, Mark was able to effectively seal the leak and secure the joint using LLFA® compression tape. This provided an economical solution that was both practical and easy.",
        "description12": "A straight joint and branch joint spliced with LLFA® Tape and LLFA® Smooth have undergone type testing and successfully meet the requirements of BS EN 50393:2006.\n\nThe test was performed in the United Kingdom by ERA technology in accordance with British Standard BS EN 50393:2006, which exceeds the requirements of the equivalent IEC standard (IEC 61442 & 60502-1)\n\nThe test was witnessed and certified by ASTA BEAB, the UK’s leading independent body for electrical testing and product safety approval.\n\nThe procedure consists of electrical baseline testing (continuity/resistance, insulation resistance, Hi-pot, etc.), followed by impact testing (see below), post impact test functional verification (underwater for 3 hours), thermal cycling in air (63 cycles), thermal cycling in water (63 cycles), post thermal cycling functional verification testing and final examination.\n\nThe impact test was performed by placing the LLFA® joint on a concrete slab and impacting it in the middle and on both ends with a 4kg wedge shaped steel block. The impacting edge of the wedge was dropped from a height of 1 meter onto the joint, so that the impacting edge was parallel and at right angles to the axis of the joint. After the impact test, the LLFA® joint was immersed at ambient temperature with a meter’s head of water. It remained in the water for three (3) hours after which the insulation resistance was tested and the result showed no change!",
        "description13": "Several repairs using different products were unsuccessfully attempted on this corroded water pipe. Even a water activated resin bandage repair had failed as the pipe degrade, causing the leak to reappear.\n\nThis time, LLFA® Tape was tasked with the challenge of sealing the leak. After removing the defective resin repair, LLFA Tape was applied to the pipe to seal the affected area completely.\n\nAs LLFA® Tape is constantly under tension, it is able to move with the pipe even as it expands and contracts in this exposed position on a roof top. In addition, LLFA® Tape will not be degraded by UV rays.\nThis blog entry is a translated summary from the Matex Co’s Blog (Japan):  http://llfa-tape.jugem.jp/"
